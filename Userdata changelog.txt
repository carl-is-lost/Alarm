Re-wrote program, building upon the first program in Lab 8.1.
Now accepts user text input.
Intro messagebox shown at start to give directions.
Correct messagebox shown if the values entered are correct.
Incorrect messagebox shown if the values are incorrect.
Clicking yes will also now clear the console window.
Clicking cancel on the incorrect messagebox will keep the original username and password and let the user try to re-enter the correct information.
